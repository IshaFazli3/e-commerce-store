# e-commerce-store

I started building an e-commerce-store for sports wear. I want to build a project to get an insight on what happens on the back-end side of a website. 
I have already made the front-page; however, there are a lot of improvements needed. And I welcome anyone who wants to work on this project with me.

I look forward to working with junior developers like me or developers who help teach junior developers how to improve on their skills. I want this 
e-commerce store to include payment options, slideshow of clothes, and a functional cart.
